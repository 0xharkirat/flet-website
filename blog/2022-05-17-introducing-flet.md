## The problem

Is there a simple solution for simple apps?

Server-side, HTML, CSS - state management between pages, forms, real-time updates.

SPA with fancy front-end and backend - REST API, JWT tokens, etc. tons of Node.js dependencies, gigabyte folder for a hello-world app.

Your ideal framework:

- Use only the language you are familiar with - don't have time to lean a fancy stack.
- Modern UI with real-time partial updates
- You are not a designer and you are OK with an out-of-the-box design
- Built-in user sessions, auth, pubsub, sql, storage
- Easy or preferably instant deployment
