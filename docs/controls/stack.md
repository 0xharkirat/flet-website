A control that positions its children on top of each other.

This control is useful if you want to overlap several children in a simple way, for example having some text and an image, overlaid with a gradient and a button attached to the bottom.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Examples

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

import flet

# ...
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
